# Linear-Algebra-2
A C++ program that implements algorithms studied in the course Linear Algebra 2 studied in Tel-Aviv university and more. 

To this moment when I'm writing this file (31/5/2023), the project ISN'T over yet as there is a lot more to do : 

Finished - the polynomial struct, includes: 

1) Basic addition, multiplcation, and long divison operations between different polynomials.
2) Finding the derivative of a polynomial p(x).
3) Finding a root of polynomial (using the bisection method and newton-rhapson algorithm).

Haven't started yet - the matrix struct

expectations - 
1) All of the basic algorithms and operations taught in Linear Algebra 1.
2) Finding the characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial (using an algorithm invented in HW 6(?)) of a given matrix.
3) Finding a Jordan base for a given matrix - EXTREMELY hard ;)

4*) Not sure if I will take this project this far and put that much of effort but implementing of the relevant Inner Product algorithms and calculations.
